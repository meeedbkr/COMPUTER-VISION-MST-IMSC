# Adaptive Thresholding Example
-----------------------------

This is an example of adaptive thresholding in Python using OpenCV and matplotlib.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   OpenCV
*   numpy
*   matplotlib

### How to use

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Make sure the prerequisites are installed.
3.  Replace the 'sudoku.png' file in the code with the image file you want to apply the adaptive thresholding to.
4.  Run the Python script. The adaptive thresholded images will be displayed.

### Explanation

This script reads an image file using OpenCV and applies adaptive thresholding to it using two different methods: mean and Gaussian. The resulting images are displayed using matplotlib.
