# Adaptive Thresholding with OpenCV
=================================

This Python script demonstrates how to apply adaptive thresholding to an image using OpenCV. Adaptive thresholding is a technique that adjusts the threshold value for each pixel based on the local neighborhood of the pixel. This allows for better thresholding of images with varying lighting conditions or contrast.

## Usage
-----

To run the script, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using ```pip```:


```pip install opencv-python```

To run the script, open a terminal or command prompt in the folder containing the script and type:


```python adaptive_thresholding.py```

This will open a window displaying the original image and the thresholded image. Press any key to close the windows.
