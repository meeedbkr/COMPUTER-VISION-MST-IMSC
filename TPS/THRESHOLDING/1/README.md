Image Thresholding with OpenCV
==============================

This Python script applies thresholding to an image using the OpenCV library. Thresholding is a process where all pixel values below a certain threshold value are set to 0 (black), and all pixel values above the threshold value are set to a maximum value (white).

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This script requires the OpenCV library to be installed. You can install OpenCV using pip:

Copy code

```pip install opencv-python```

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository:


```git clone https://github.com/meeedbkr/COMPUTER-VISION-MST-IMSC.git```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:


```cd image-thresholding```

3.  Run the script:


```python threshold.py```

Usage
-----

1.  Modify the ```threshold_value``` and ```max_value``` variables in ```threshold.py``` as desired.
2.  Run the script using the instructions in the "Installing" section above.
3.  The binary image will be displayed in a new window titled "Binary Image".
