# Image Thresholding with OpenCV
==============================

This Python script loads an image, converts it to grayscale, and applies thresholding to create a binary image.

## Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
*   OpenCV library

## Usage
-----

1.  Install the OpenCV library using pip:
    
    
    ``pip install opencv-python```
    
2.  Save the image you want to process to your local file system.
    
3.  Update the file path to your image in the ```cv2.imread()``` function call in the code.
    
4.  Run the script using the following command:
    
    
    ```python image_thresholding.py```
    
5.  The binary image will be displayed in a new window. Press any key to close the window.
