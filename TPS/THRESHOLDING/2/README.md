# Adaptive Thresholding with OpenCV
=================================

This Python script loads an image in grayscale, resizes it, and applies adaptive thresholding to create a binary image using OpenCV.

## Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
*   OpenCV library

## Usage
-----

1.  Install the OpenCV library using pip:
    
    
    ```pip install opencv-python```
    
2.  Save the image you want to process to your local file system.
    
3.  Update the file path to your image in the ```cv2.imread()``` function call in the code.
    
4.  Run the script using the following command:
    
    
    ```python adaptive_thresholding.py```
    
5.  The original image and the adaptive thresholded image will be displayed in two separate windows. Press any key to close the windows.
