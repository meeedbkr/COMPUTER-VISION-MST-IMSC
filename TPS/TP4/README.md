# OpenCV Trackbar Examples
========================

This repository contains three simple examples of how to use trackbars in OpenCV with Python. Trackbars are GUI components that allow you to set a variable value by sliding a button along a bar. They are commonly used in OpenCV to control parameters like color, radius, and scale.

## Usage
-----

The three examples included in this repository are:

1.  **Text in Image:** Displays an image and a text with a scale that can be adjusted using a trackbar.
2.  **Circle with Radius:** Displays a black image with a circle in the center that changes radius with a trackbar.
3.  **Circle with Color:** Displays a black image with a circle in the center that changes color with a trackbar.

To use the examples, simply run the Python scripts using your preferred Python environment.

## Requirements
------------

To run the examples, you will need the following:

*   Python 3.x
*   OpenCV library for Python
*   Numpy library for Python

## Examples
--------

### Text in Image

Displays an image and a text with a scale that can be adjusted using a trackbar.



### Circle with Radius
